Core SOA ontology and examples

This repository contains a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) ontology and example graphs conforming to this ontology.
The ontology and examples were originally defined by The Open Group (https://www.opengroup.org/soa/source-book/ontologyv2/p10.htm) and later incorporated into the international standard ISO18384-3:2016 - Information technology — Reference Architecture for Service Oriented Architecture (SOA RA) Part 3: Service Oriented Architecture ontology (https://www.iso.org/standard/63106.html).
